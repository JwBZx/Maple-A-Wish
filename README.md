Maple A Wish, a MapleStory-Related App (written in JavaScript and Meteor) by Jonathan Bruce (@JwBZx)

- What is "Maple-A-Wish"?

Maple-A-Wish is a Todo list style app based off of two basic apps for Meteor developers: the Todo List app by Meteor and
the Leaderboard app by David Turnball (links to both down below). My todo list's purpose is to help players of a popular
MMORPG called "MapleStory" (which I am addicted to) keep track of their tasks, item wishlists, and more.

I will be updating this app as time goes on (this will be my first project), so there will (hopefully) always be new
features and things for you to check out!

- Where can I find the app?

Currently the app has not been released, but, once it is released, I will try to put the app online and also maybe
publish it to mobile app stores.

- Can I help?

Yes! If you have any ideas, suggestions, constructive criticism, or snide remarks, you can always feel free to leave
them on this project so that I can see them. I hope that you will want to make "Maple-A-Wish" as great of an app as it
can possibly be!

Thank You for checking out "Maple-A-Wish" and God Bless!
